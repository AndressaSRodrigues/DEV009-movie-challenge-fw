## 2. Technology Stack

MotionHub was developed as part of a coursework project and utilizes the following technologies:

### Angular

Angular was the core framework used to structure and build the frontend of MotionHub. It facilitated the creation of components, services, and modules that formed the user interface. Angular's routing system was used to manage navigation between different parts of the application, enabling seamless transitions and user interactions.

### TypeScript

TypeScript was the primary programming language used to write the frontend code. It added strong typing to the application, catching errors during development and providing better code quality and maintainability. It was instrumental in defining the data models, logic, and interactions within MotionHub.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS was employed to style the user interface of MotionHub. It allowed for the quick and consistent styling of components and layouts through utility classes. This approach streamlined the design process and ensured a responsive and visually appealing user interface without the need for extensive custom CSS.

## 3. Design and Prototypes

### Color palette

MotionHub's design is characterized by a thoughtfully chosen color palette that enhances the user experience and gives the website a modern and visually appealing look. The primary colors used are:

### Fonts

MotionHub uses a pair of carefully selected fonts to achieve a balance of style and readability:

**Koulen (cursive):** The 'Koulen' font is used for creative and decorative elements.

**Montserrat (sans-serif):** The 'Montserrat' font is the primary font for text and content.

The combination of the color palette and fonts in MotionHub aims to provide a visually appealing, user-friendly, and modern design. The yellow highlight color adds energy and draws attention to key elements, while the white and gray colors maintain readability and simplicity. The choice of fonts balances style with clarity, ensuring that the website is both attractive and functional.

### Figma Prototypes

High fidelity prototypes were design to anticipate user experience. Both versions, desktop and mobile, receibe feedback from potential users and were then improved accordingly. These are the final prototypes:
